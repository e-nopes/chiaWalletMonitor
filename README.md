Get notifications when you get Chia XCH  -- Reach me at chia@ifhya.com


When your wallet gets XCH, you can get a notification via Popup, Push notice through Pushover, Discord, Slack or a custom sound file.

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required modules

Start: `python ./chiaWallet.py`
Run on windows with `pythonw` instead of `python` to run it in the background on windows.  Linux users have their own ways.

Currently notification support is:  `toast, audio file, Pushover push notifications, Slack, Discord, PushBullet` - Let me know any others you'd like integrated!
